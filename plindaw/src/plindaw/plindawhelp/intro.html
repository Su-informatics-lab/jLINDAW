<H1>pLINDAW: A Fuzzy Query Based Data Warehouse System for Real-time Pan-LINCS Data Integration and Visualization</H1>
The Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures
(LINCS) program founded by the National Institute of Health has
been generating large and diverse datasets to systematically characterize
the effects of perturbations on cellular disease model system.
Potentially an invaluable resource to a wide range of research fields,
these datasets are highly heterogeneous in terms of disparate focuses
and evoluting standards and formats. The Integrative and Translational
Network-based Cellular Signature Analyzer (itNETZ) platform,
developed by our Wake Forest LINCS Computation Center, systematically
addresses these Big Data challenges and bridges such
abundant LINCS resources and the needs of general LINCS users.<br><br>

The pan-LINCS Data Warehouse (pLINDAW) system is the
major interface and data portal of the itNETZ platform designed
to facilitate users of various backgrounds and interests to utilize the

LINCS data. The pLINDAW system incorporates LINCS data and
itNETZ discoveries (Figure 1 A), allows flexible data integration by
fuzzy querying using a number of similarity metrics, and supports
on-the-fly data modeling and visualization. Currently a java-based
application, jLINDAW (Figure 1 B), is available for general users,
and a direct access to the data warehouse for advanced users.
The pLINDAW system is distinguished by the signature-based
data integration and similarity-based fuzzy query.
